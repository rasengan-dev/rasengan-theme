An utility component for Image which offers a lazy loading behavior with a previewing animation for enhancing UX

Images are loading when they are in the viewport by default, and a previewing animation is displayed while the image is loading. But you can change that behavior as you want.

## Installation

You can install the `@rasenganjs/image` package using the following command:

```bash
npm install @rasenganjs/image
```

or

```bash
yarn add @rasenganjs/image
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how you can use the `@rasenganjs/image` package:

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import Image from '@rasenganjs/image';
import logo from './logo.svg';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Image
      src={logo}
      alt="Image"
      width={400}
      height={300}
    />
  );
};
```

### With `URI`

```tsx
import Image from '@rasenganjs/image';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Image
      src={{ uri: "https://example.com/image.jpg" }}
      alt="Image"
      width={400}
      height={300}
    />
  );
};
```
